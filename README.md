In this IBM Data Science Course capstone project, I assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a new Space rocket company called SpaceY and would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Allon Musk. My job is to determine the cost of each launch and to predict if a launch programm will be successful or not. I have to do this by gathering information about Space X and creating an interactive dashboards for my team. I also determine if SpaceX will reuse it's booster rockets after each launch. I will use Data analysis and Data Science methodologies as well as training a machine learning model using publicly available information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage rocket booster.
